===================

> This obnoxiously section is here to tell you that.... I don’t think that it is horrible but it is old and just showing the very basic of handling file request from your html file use 'http'. If you want to serve static files, nowadays, we already have express.js, and it's easier !

Remarkably so since there was no install requirement. This time we are going to return static files like plain ol’ Html, Css and Javascript files..
